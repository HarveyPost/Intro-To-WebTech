                <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security, making
                    it challenging to
                    counterfeit. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat currencies), cryptocurrencies
                    operate on
                    decentralised networks based on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that
                    records all
                    transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency and security without the need for
                    a central authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity for their potential to provide secure, anonymous
                    transactions, and their
                    capacity to reach individuals and businesses across the globe without the need for traditional
                    banking systems. However,
                    they also face criticism and regulatory scrutiny due to their volatility, use in illegal activities,
                    and potential
                    environmental impact due to the energy-intensive process of mining, which is used to validate
                    transactions and secure
                    the network. Despite these challenges, cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, promising innovative
                    financial and
                    technological advancements.

                    <h3>History of Cryptocurrency</h3>
                    <p>
                        The history of cryptocurrency begins in the late 20th century with the development of
                        cryptographic techniques that laid
                        the groundwork for secure, decentralised digital currencies. The idea of creating a form of
                        currency that used
                        cryptography for security can be traced back to the 1980s with the invention of digital cash
                        protocols that aimed to
                        preserve user anonymity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, it wasn't until 2009 that the concept of cryptocurrency became a reality with the
                        launch of Bitcoin by an
                        anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin introduced the world to
                        blockchain technology â€” a
                        decentralised ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. This
                        innovation ensured that the
                        currency was secure, transparent, and free from central authority control, solving the
                        double-spending problem without
                        the need for a trusted third party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following Bitcoin's success, numerous other cryptocurrencies were developed, introducing various
                        technological
                        advancements and concepts. Ethereum, launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, brought smart
                        contracts into the crypto space,
                        allowing for more complex applications of blockchain technology beyond just transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The history of cryptocurrency is marked by rapid innovation, speculation, and volatility, with
                        significant interest from
                        both retail and institutional investors. Despite facing regulatory challenges and skepticism,
                        the ecosystem has grown to
                        encompass a wide range of currencies, applications, and communities, highlighting its potential
                        to disrupt traditional
                        financial systems and beyond.

                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <p>
                    Cryptocurrencies operate on a technology called blockchain, which is a decentralised ledger of all
                    transactions across a
                    network of computers. This ledger ensures that the same digital token cannot be spent twice and
                    allows for secure and
                    transparent transactions without the need for a central authority like a bank or government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the heart of how cryptocurrencies work is the process of mining or consensus mechanisms like
                    Proof of Work (PoW) or
                    Proof of Stake (PoS). In PoW, miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles.
                    The first miner to
                    solve the puzzle adds a new block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with
                    cryptocurrency. This process
                    not only secures the network and verifies transactions but also creates new tokens, serving as a
                    mechanism for
                    distributing new cryptocurrency without a central issuer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PoS, on the other hand, allows for the creation of new blocks based on the holding of existing
                    tokens, offering a less
                    energy-intensive alternative to PoW. Participants "stake" their tokens as collateral to validate
                    transactions and create
                    new blocks, receiving transaction fees as rewards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transactions are sent between peers using cryptographic keys for security. Each transaction is
                    broadcast to the network
                    and included in the blockchain after being confirmed by miners or validators, ensuring its validity
                    and irreversibility
                    without the need for trust in a third party.
