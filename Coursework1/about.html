                <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
                <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates
                    independently of a central bank. It's built on blockchain technology to gain transparency,
                    immutability, and decentralisation.</p>

                    <h3>History of Cryptocurrency</h3>
                    <p>The idea of cryptocurrency began with Bitcoin in 2009, created by an anonymous entity known as
                        Satoshi
                        Nakamoto. Since then, the crypto space has expanded with over thousands of cryptocurrencies in
                        existence
                        today.

                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <p>At its core, cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to maintain a secure and decentralised
                    record of transactions. This technology ensures trust, security, and freedom from central authority.
